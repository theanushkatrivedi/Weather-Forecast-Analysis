🌦️ Weather Forecast Analysis
An Analytical Exploration in Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Daily Insights
This project is not just a weather dashboard. It is a functional prototype for a personalized environmental decision support system. It serves as an exercise in product thinking, demonstrating how we can move beyond simply reporting data to creating tools that help users make better, more informed daily decisions.
